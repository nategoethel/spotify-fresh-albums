The goal of this project is to find all of the albums on /r/hiphopheads with the `[FRESH]` tag, look them up on Spotify, and then add them to a playlist. This can happen as often as you want (e.g. hourly, daily, weekly).

To do this, we leverage both the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) and the [Reddit](API).
